What you have to build
A Python system that:

Reads and cleans a messy salesdata.txt file (pipe‑delimited, non‑UTF‑8, with data quality issues).
​

Validates and filters out invalid records according to strict rules.
​

Fetches product information from an external API (you will implement this via a function, probably with requests).
​

Analyzes sales (totals, by product, by region, customer behavior, etc.).
​

Generates reports (printed to console and/or written to files under output/).
